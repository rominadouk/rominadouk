I'm a Full-Stack Software Engineer recently graduated from General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive Program. I'm looking to learn and grow alongside the tech world to sharpen my foundational skills and gain new ones along the way, so that I can leave my impact on our future with technology. I am currently strengthening my skills in both frontend and backend processes. I am always open to discussing software development topics!
